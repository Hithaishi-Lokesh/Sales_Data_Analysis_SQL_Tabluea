 the narrator outlines a project planning approach using Aim's grid for a data analysis initiative the company, the sales director, recognizes the need for data-driven insights and convenes a meeting with key stakeholders, including the sales, IT, and data analysis teams. They define the project's purpose, identify stakeholders, outline the desired end result—a functional Tableau dashboard—and establish success criteria, such as cost savings and increased sales. The IT team, is responsible for the sales management software, while the Data Analysts, will analyze data from the MySQL database to create the dashboard. Additionally, Data Engineers, maintain the data infrastructure, particularly when a data warehouse is involved. OLTP (the operational database) and OLAP (the analytical data warehouse), emphasizing that the latter allows for effective data analysis without disrupting daily operations.
